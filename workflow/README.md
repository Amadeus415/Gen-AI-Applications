# LLM Workflows Examples
## What is a Workflow?
 workflow is a structured way to use LLMs (Large Language Models) where we break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Unlike autonomous agents, workflows follow predefined paths and are more controlled. Think of it like a recipe - you know exactly what steps you'll take, in what order, and what the expected outcome should be.
## Types of Workflows & Examples
### 1. Prompt Chaining
reaking tasks into sequential steps, where each LLM call builds on the previous one.
 [ ] Example 1: Document Writing System
 - Generate outline
 - Review outline against criteria
 - Write full document from approved outline
### 2. Parallelization
unning multiple LLM tasks simultaneously, either by breaking into sections or getting multiple perspectives.
 [ ] Example 1: Content Moderation
 - One LLM processes content
 - Another LLM checks for inappropriate content
 - Compare and aggregate results
 [ ] Example 2: Code Review System
 - Multiple LLMs review code simultaneously
 - Each checks different aspects (security, style, efficiency)
 - Combine findings into final report
### 3. Evaluator-Optimizer
ne LLM generates content while another provides feedback in a loop.
 [ ] Example 1: Translation Improvement System
 - Initial translation
 - Evaluation of nuances and accuracy
 - Iterative improvements based on feedback
### 4. Routing
lassifies input and directs to specialized handlers.
 [ ] Example 1: Support Ticket Router
 - Classify incoming request type
 - Route to appropriate specialized prompt
 - Handle response based on category
### 5. Orchestrator-Workers
entral LLM coordinates multiple worker LLMs for complex tasks.
 [ ] Example 1: Multi-File Code Update System
 - Orchestrator analyzes full project scope
 - Delegates specific file changes to workers
 - Synthesizes all changes into final solution
